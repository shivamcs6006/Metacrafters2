# Solidity Token(Metacrafters)

The solidity program is a simple "Token Manager" with mint and burn functionalities. It demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two functions "mint" and "burn" and mapping data structure of solidity for mapping of Ethereum addresses to Supply values. The mint function takes two parameters address and value and is used to increase the total supply and balance of the specified address. Similarly the burn function also takes two parameters address and value and works exactly opposite to mint and decrease the total supply and balance of the specified address.
